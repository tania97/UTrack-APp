# UTrack-APP
App that tracks your favourite locations worldwide.
Written in Java (Android SDK).

UTrack is an app which aims to help people with recording the important information in easy and fast way. The app uses the WiFi network, GPS and Google Maps which allows the user to track his location for further tracking. User can choose his own category of the things that he wants to track. With UTrack there is a possibility to make a picture of an object/ building/ place, write down the name and notes about it and save the information to the database. After saving the data, the location mark appears on the map, so the exact location can be known.  Furthermore, it is possible to make an overview of all the registrations in the UTrack history window and use the data for other purposes. 
As an example we can take a scientist who makes a research about fox population in the specific natural habitat. When he sees the needed animal type, the UTrack app writes down the location together with camera picture and text description. Later on the scientist sees how the foxes are spread all over the area (displayed on the map) and which part has the biggest population density. With the database he can extract the information and use it for further research.
Another example can be a simple tourist, who instead of tracking foxes, tracks favorite bakery places all over the city/ country/ world. By personal experience,  it is quite common to find a good place, but forget its name and street name. But UTrack app lists all the registrations made during the travelling so that user can remember the exact location of the place and find it through some time.
